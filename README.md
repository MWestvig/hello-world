# hello-world

Hey there world.
As you can see, this is my first "project" on GitHub. I plan on making many more as I continue with my studies, so keep an eye out for them.
I'm currently focused on learning Python, but I will branch out into other languages as time goes by. And hopefully, one day, I'll get into some game development, which is my eventual dream.
